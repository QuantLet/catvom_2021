Published in: 'Cryptocurrencies and the Velocity of Money (Pernice et al., 2021)'

Description: 'This Quantlet is primarily focused on data manipulation and error calculation. It defines a series of functions for normalizing, standardizing, and calculating mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) between measured and approximated velocity data. It then applies these functions to a dataset, and saves the error data and error summaries.'

Keywords: Data Manipulation, Normalization, Standardization, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error
